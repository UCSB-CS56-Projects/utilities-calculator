Overall:
After trying running the project, and reading through the README file, this project works properly most part. All the functions that are mentioned in README file work the way it's suppose to. The targets show up after ant -p are clean and run, which I think it's enough for now since all we have right now is a basic calculator. And the package name matches the project name.The build.xml file is clear as well.

Issue:
1.However, there's one bug. If the user press the '.' in the GUI, it doesn't actually show up and create a decimal, therefore, the calculator doesn't accept decimal numbers.
2.We could add test cases for the calculator in CalculatorTest.java file.
3. then add test as a main target in ant -p

Additional features:
1. add the function square, x^2.
2. add the function square root, x^1/2.
3. add trigonometric functions, sin, cos, tan.
5. add a binary convertor.
4. add the descriptions for all the functions above README file.
